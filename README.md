# Random User Profile Generator

Welcome to the Random User Profile Generator! This web application fetches random user profiles from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) and displays their information, including name, email, phone, location, age, and gender. It's like a "Lorem Ipsum" for people, providing placeholder profiles for various use cases.

## How It Works

This project uses JavaScript and the Random User API to generate and display random user profiles. Here's an overview of how the key steps and functionalities are implemented:

1. **Generate Profile:** Click the "Generate Profile" button to fetch a random user profile from the API.

2. **Display Information:** The fetched user profile is displayed on the page, showing the user's name, email, phone, location, age, and gender.

3. **Background Color:** Depending on the user's gender, the background color of the page changes. For male profiles, it becomes steel blue, and for female profiles, it becomes rebecca purple.

## Use Cases

- Quickly populate user interface mockups with realistic-looking profiles.
- Test data visualization and layout without needing real user data.
- Placeholder profiles for development and testing purposes.
